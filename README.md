Pleased to make your acquaintence!

This is just the beginning in the adventures of learning code. I love computers, video games, and learning how to break things, and maybe put them back together. Have you ever seen the inside of a laptop LCD screen? I have. It's pretty. 
Should I mention I have a healthy love for coffee?  And tea. And books. And animals. And dark chocolate.
